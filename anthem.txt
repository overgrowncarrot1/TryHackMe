First, as always, run an nmap scan on the machine
	nmap xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
	Well that didnt work, lets do nmap -Pn xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
	hmm...we got some information but not all, what is the webserver port
	nmap -p0-99 -Pn -vv xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
	We still dont know a possible password though, lets trying running an NMAP script
        nmap -A -p0-99 -Pn -vv -sC -sV xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
		Now we found a robots.txt file
		http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/robots.txt
		The Umbarco looks like a password, lets try that
	Now we need to find the admin
		Lets look at the blog posts and see if that tells us anything
		There is a poem, lets google that poem
		There is the admin for the page
	Now we need to find the flags
		They are hidden in the pages, the hint tells us to inspect the pages
			Flag one, on the we are hiring page in the meta content
			Flag 2, main page under nav, li, div, form, input
			Flag 3, the picture of Jane Doe
			Flag 4, IT department page
	Now we need to install remmina, which is used for RDP within Linux system
		sudo apt-get install remmina
		Now a username and password, we already figured this out in task one, remember
		Now lets get the admin username and password
			Go to this pc, then go to view and view hidden files
			From there lets see if anything is hidden in the C:/
			we can see that backup is, however we do not have access to the txt file
			that is ok, change the permissions to gain access
			there is our next password
		Lets not reinvent the wheel here, just log out and log back in
			administrator
			ChangeMeBaby1MoreTime
WE ARE DONE, YEAH!!!
